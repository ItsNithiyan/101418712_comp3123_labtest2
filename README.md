# Weather App

This is a weather app built using ReactJS for my COMP 3123 Lab Test 2. The app allows users to check the weather of any city in real-time by fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features
- Search weather by city name
- Displays temperature, weather condition, and wind speed
- Uses icons to represent different weather conditions

## API Used
The app fetches weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions). You will need an API key to make it work.

API Endpoint:
